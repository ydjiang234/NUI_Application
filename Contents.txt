I am writing to apply for the research associate position of the SAFER project, which was announced on the  University of Bristol website. I am completing my PhD degree in Earthquake Engineering and Engineering Seismology at the Istituto Universitario di Studi Superiori di Pavia (IUSS) with an expected graduation date of May 2018.

I am deeply attracted by your SAFER project, which includes innovational seismic device design and challenging shaking table tests. As a candidate, here are what I could immediately bring to the table:

\textbf{Laboratory Experiences:} In my PhD research, I have designed and conducted experimental tests to characterize the flexural behaviour of concrete-filled steel tube (CFST) columns. Additionally, I also have some laboratory experiences during my research assistant period in the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, where I assisted to prepare the CFST specimens and to conduct the steel coupon tests. My laboratory experiences prepare me to face any challenges in the upcoming experimental programmes of your SAFER project.

\textbf{Earthquake Engineering Background:} Majoring in Earthquake Engineering, I have completed a series of seismic specified courses, particularly the ``Seismic Design of Foundation'' and the ``Seismic Isolation and Dissipation'', which would enable me to adapt to your project fast and smoothly.

\textbf{Programming Skills:} I have developed solid programming skills in Matlab and Python during my undergraduate and postgraduate training. These productive tools allow me to propose mathematical models, to carry out the parametric study as well as to post-process analytical data in your project.

\textbf{Experience of Research Findings Presentation and Research Papers Authoring:} I have authored and co-authored 3 journal and 8 conference papers during my PhD career. Meantime, I have presented my research achievements orally in 6 international conferences and workshops. These experiences fully prepare me for any future report delivery and article authoring.

I believe that my research background, skills and experiences well qualify me for the research associate position. My curriculum vitae is enclosed for your kind perusal. Thank you for your consideration and I look forward to hearing from you soon.
